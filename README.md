# BV-BRC-HostAnnotation

## Overview

The Bacterial-Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center contains GenBank genomic data and associated metadata on bacteria and 
viruses isolated from thousands of unique hosts. The designation of a host as the organism infected by the microbe, is an 
important variable for analysis of genomic sequence data, and an efficient mechanism for using host or host groups to 
select records from the BV-BRC. This requires that the host designation in the sequence record follows standardized 
taxonomic names. This is frequently not the case for GenBank records, with the 'host' modifier of the 'source' feature 
containing a variety of values from official taxonomic names to various common names and name synonyms. To provide host 
names based on official taxonomy, we have developed an automated host annotation pipeline to ascertain the proper 
scientific taxonomic name based on the provided GenBank host name.


## Purpose

- The Host Annotation Pipeline provides automated scientific name curation for GenBank host names referenced in the 
BV-BRC application.
- The curator application supports manual review and update of the annotations generated by the Host Annotation Pipeline, as 
well as direct creation of annotations within the pipeline�s database (these will be given priority over automated annotations).
- A more detailed explanation of the workflow can be found [here](./workflow.md).

## Applications

The BV-BRC Host Annotation project contains several sub-projects, including a web application
for ""manual" curation, a Windows Web API (web services) application, the main library (DLL)
used by the Web API and console / command-line application, and an example Python client that 
demonstrates Web API usage.
